Code for handling Data Analysis on CSV files, often with the need to handle corrupted data 

Flow.py calculates stream flow over a given time interval, using 2 different input CSVs and has an algorithm to solve time stamp gaps between the CSVs
and a method to exclude measurment errors from the calculated flow.
